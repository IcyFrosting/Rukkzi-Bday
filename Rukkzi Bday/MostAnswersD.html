    <h2> You Answered Most Under D </h2>

    <p>You sure are loyal! Staying even the music is bad af! A true war hero! You like to pretend you're the
        kirkiest ho in da city for liking $niche music$, but in reality you can never be a quirky as Rukkzi! You canâ€™t
        wear a rukkzi wig and be rukkzi. You can read a philosophy book but you will never understand words of
        true baguette philosophers! We know you only read them to be special!!!! What's with the bunch of
        noise and random conversation in this album anyway [I cant find a question mark on this keyboard its
        my sisters laptop] We get it, you're artistic!!</p>
