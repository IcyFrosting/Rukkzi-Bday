    <h2>You Answered Most Under C</h2>

    <p>You're sophisticated and a beautiful child of God. You have a link to higher reality and you can hear
        rainbows sing the most homosexual tunes that there are. You're set in your views; even when you're
        wrong, you remain stone firm! Philosophy books are your Bible. You read Violet bend over the grass and
        weep!</p>
